### Basic-image-classification
This repository contains a python machine learning project, where a 28x28 pixel image is passed to the ML model, and it predicts the class of object in the image.
Its preferable to open the file in a Jupyter notebook or in Google Colaboratory, or any other notebook. 
A .py file is also added, so that can be used in the absence of a notebook.
Needs the tensorflow module installed.
